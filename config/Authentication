Authentication
  Provide users with a way to login to app
  Store password encrypted in database
  create sessions so users stay logged in
  destroy session to logout user 

Encryption
  How it works: 
    take in password and a "salt" and returns a hashed password

* need to add digest to password
 

* f.password_field 

bcrypt gem generates salt, password hashing

||= 


THE GOOD WAY
rails engine: an app running inside of the app

Devise Modules
  Database authenticatable: encrypts and stores passwords in the db
  Omniauthable: multi-provider authentication
  Confirmable: email confirmation
  Recoverable: resets passwords and sends reset instructions
  Registerable: signs up users
  Timeoutable: expires sessions
